      # IPA

      For vowels, think of tongue (up, middle, down) and mouth (open, middle, closed, at the same time as rounded or flat)

      For consonants, think of where the sound is produced, from front to back (lips to back of throat)

      # Alphabet

      Listen to a recording of the alphabet, and speak it out loud.

      Provides initial exposure to the sounds of the language, both hearing and speaking.
