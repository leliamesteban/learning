      # IPA consonants

      For consonants, think of where the sound is produced, from front to back (lips to back of throat)

      # Alphabet

      Listen to a recording of the alphabet, and speak it out loud.

      Provides initial exposure to the sounds of the language, both hearing and speaking.

      ---

      # Sounds

      Go through each of the sounds in the language, without worrying about learning to read
